# Linear-Regression-in-R
This repository contains my university project on linear regression. Project description and tasks are written in croatian and the code is written in R.

Short task descriptions:

1.Read the given data.

2.Draw scatter plot of original data and 6 transformations. 

3.Review the plots. Is it possible to assume linear dependency in any model?

4.Take two best models and do linear regression on them. Calculate R^2 and F statistic.

5.Draw residual graph nd check the distribution of standard residuals .

6.Check 95% confidence intervals.
